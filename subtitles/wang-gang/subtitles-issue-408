 Hello everyone this is Wang Gang
In today’s video I will share with you
how to make home styled sweet and sour cabbage
First, let’s prepare a cabbage
cut it in half after pealing the leaves off
Then slant-cut into pieces 
Be sure not to use an iron knife
otherwise the cabbage might have a rusty taste
you could also use your hand to rip it into pieces
Next step is to prepare the side ingredients
crush a few cloves of garlic and chop them up
cut a few dried chilli peppers into pieces
There are different levels of spiciness of dried peppers
you can make your own choice base on your preference
Finally, prepare half of green and red peppers each and cut into pieces
The peppers make a good colour scheme for the dish
The next step is to make the sauce
add a spoonful of salt into a bowl
add 3g of soy sauce
and 3g vinegar 
lastly add some water mixed with starch
Now, let’s start cooking
first, we heat up the pan
add some oil once the pan is heated
we could add a bit more oil than usual
Once the oil reaches 180 degrees, quick-fry the garlic and dried chilli peppers in
then put in the red and green peppers and the cabbage
Make sure to set on high heat 
otherwise the cabbage might become soggy
Stir fry on high heat for 40 seconds then add the sauce
stir fry and mix them well
lastly add some oil and quick-fry for a few seconds, the dish is ready to serve
a tasty dish of sweet and sour cabbage is now finished
Here is a summary for the tips
first, you cannot add seasoning during the cooking process, making the sauce beforehand is necessary.
second, high heat is needed for stir-frying cabbage, you can add some more oil to prevent overcooking the cabbage.
Third, the sauce must be added towards the end. The cabbage will become soggy and less tasty if you add the sauce early
That’s all for the tips.
